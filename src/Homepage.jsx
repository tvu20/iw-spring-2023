            Musical ensemble improvisation is an incredibly complex, impressive,
            and unpredictable phenomenon. In such a performance, musicians pick
            up on existing dynamics within the group, follow a set of unspoken
            rules, and adapt over time to meet the needs of their fellow
            ensemble members.

            A significant amount of behavioral research has been done on the
            parallel between self-organization in non-human complex systems such
            as ant colonies or fish swarms and the process of musical
            improvisation. The common thread lies with the presence of emergent
            patterns, which occurs when a system is observed to have properties
            or interactions arising when observed at a high level that cannot be
            predicted by its individual parts.

        Within a musical ensemble, musicians: Pick up on existing dynamics
        within the group Follow a set of constraints/rules Adapt over time to
        meet the needs of the group Musical improvisation demonstrates many
        properties of self-organization within non-human complex systems!

        Gaining a better understanding behind the underlying mechanisms of
        improvisation and musical emergence would have a lot of implications for
        the artistic field: for example, new composition techniques could be
        developed through using swarm intelligence models to generate innovative
        and dynamic compositions, or can help budding musicians develop their
        musicality and artistic voice.

      <h3>Project Goals</h3>
      <p>Design an algorithm for generating music using self-organization</p>
      <p>
        Generate outputs and evaluate sections of the algorithm to demonstrate
        proof of concept{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        Curate an experience for musicians and listeners to approach this media
        and gain a better understanding of the field â€” still allows for an
        interactive music experience that spreads awareness of this field of
        study so far!
