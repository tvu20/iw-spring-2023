        <p>
          Rules in improvisational ensembles do not dictate the outcome of the
          performance by defining each performerâ€™s exact behavior; instead, they
          orient the behavior of each performer but cannot predict the behavior
          of a system as a whole. Rules come in both physical and abstract
          constraints: physical constraints being the capabilities of an
          instrument or performer, and abstract constraints in the form of genre
          and communication between musicians.
        </p>
        <p>
          When all individual entities of a system follow a common set of rules,
          a structure emerges at the macroscopic level of the system. This
          emergent becomes a constraining force that acts back on the
          performers, forming a feedback loop between the microscopic and
          macroscopic levels of the system. At every moment, the decision of a
          performer orients the improvisation in a precise path due to
          influencing the entropy of the system and enforcing certain rules.
